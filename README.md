# Example 2

Input:
In an introductory English class taught by Professor Umbridge assigns the students
and impossible task for counting all the unique words in a ten-volume encyclopedia
of magic.

By her definition words are sequences of one or more consecutive alphabetic characters
in upper or lower case. Their uniqueness should be determined in a case insensitive way,
so  words like "magic", "Magic", "MaGiC" should be treated as the same.
